What is a remote repository? 

A remote repository means a repository/version/copy of your project that is stored not locally on your computer, but rather on github/the internet/a larger network somewhere. 
You could have multiple remote repositories, which could be possibly read-only or read/write.
They are essential for collaborating and need to be managed with pushing and pulling data/commits to and from the repository to share changes/work you've done.
